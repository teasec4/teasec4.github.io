            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Pranayama in yoga is the fourth limb of eight-fold Raja Yoga. It is often spelled as Pranayam. Only after attaining Asana Siddhi (Mastery in Yoga Posture), a yoga aspirant is eligible to start the breath control exercises. It plays a vital role not only in yoga but also in other spiritual practices like Japa, Meditation, and Prayer.
            </p>
            <p>Considering its paramount importance in yoga and spiritual life, substantive knowledge of this breath-control exercise is necessary for a spiritual seeker and a yoga aspirant.
            </p>
            <p>This article aims to serve as a complete guide to impart the expert knowledge of pranayama that includes the meaning, definition, history, elements, types, philosophy, and practice. Besides, it highlights the various yogic standpoints on the subject.
            </p>
            <h2 id="whatis">What is Pranayama</h2>
            <p>It is a part of yoga practice that includes specific breath control exercises.
            </p>
            <p>If respiration is disturbed, your mind becomes disturbed. Also, while your mind is disturbed by anger or excitement, your respiration also will get disturbed. If you get control over your mind, you will have control over respiration. Similarly, if you restrain your breathing, you could restrain your mind. Simply, Pranayama is the set of breath control exercises that restrain respiration.
            </p>
            <h2 id="meaning">Pranayama Meaning</h2>
            <p>The term Pranayama is the combination of two Sanskrit words: Prana and Yama. One meaning of Prana is Breath. In that sense, it is breath controlling exercises or breath regulating techniques. In other words, it is the control of Prana.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Prana</h3>
            <p>Prana is commonly understood as a breath. Actually, it is more than that. At the micro-level, it is the vital energy that connects all the parts of the body. It makes you feel like a whole, yet each cell of the body is different from one another. Breathe is one of the media through which the vital energy or Prana makes you connected and feel like a whole.
            </p>
            <p>If the connecting mechanism leaves the body, then the body becomes dead. The same life energy exists in all living beings. In non-living beings, it exists in some other manner. It is the dynamic force that exists inside an atom.
            </p>
            <p>According to Indian Philosophy, the whole universe is made up of two materials. One is Akasa or Ether and the other is Prana.
            </p>
            <h3 id="history">Pranayama History</h3>
            <p>Pranayama is an age-old science of yoga that has been in practice in India for more than three thousand five hundred years. We could find references in ancient texts like Chandogya Upanishad, Brihudharanya Upanishad, Maitri Upanishad, Bhagavad Gita, and Patanjali Yoga Sutra.
            </p>
            <h4 id="types">Types of Pranayama</h4>
            <p>Generally, the types of Pranayama are two-fold: Sakala and Kevala.
                Sakala Pranayama is a breathing pattern that includes Inhalation and Exhalation; whereas Kevala Pranayama is a type that does not include Inhalation and Exhalation. It is an advanced type and Adepts in Yoga can practice this.

            </p>
            <p>Yet another general classification is there: Sagarbha and Agarbha. Sagarbha Pranayam is a breath control practice with Mantra and Meditation; whereas Agarbha Pranayam is without Mantra and Meditation.
